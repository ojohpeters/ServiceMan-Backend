# Skills Management System - Complete Documentation

## üìã Overview

The ServiceMan Platform now includes a comprehensive skills management system that allows servicemen to showcase their expertise and enables better matching between clients and service providers.

## ‚ú® Features Implemented

### 1. Skill Model
- **Categorized Skills**: Skills organized by category (Technical, Manual, Creative, Professional, Other)
- **Many-to-Many Relationship**: Servicemen can have multiple skills
- **Soft Deletion**: Skills marked as inactive instead of deleted
- **Timestamps**: Track creation and update times

### 2. Skills During Registration
- Servicemen can add skills when creating their account
- Skills validated against active skills in database
- Automatic profile association

### 3. Profile Management
- View skills on serviceman profiles
- Add/remove skills after registration
- Update skills via profile endpoint

### 4. Admin Control
- Only admins can create new skills
- Admin interface with bulk actions
- Track skill usage (number of servicemen per skill)

## üîß Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration (React/JavaScript)

#### List Skills by Category
```javascript
async function getSkillsByCategory(category) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/users/skills/?category=${category}`
  );
  const skills = await response.json();
  return skills;
}

// Usage
const technicalSkills = await getSkillsByCategory('TECHNICAL');
```

#### Add Skills to Serviceman Profile
```javascript
async function addSkills(servicemanId, skillIds, token) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/users/servicemen/${servicemanId}/skills/`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ skill_ids: skillIds }),
    }
  );
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}

// Usage
const result = await addSkills(5, [1, 15, 23], userToken);
console.log(result.message); // "Added 3 skill(s) successfully."
```

#### Display Serviceman Skills
```javascript
async function getServicemanSkills(servicemanId) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/users/servicemen/${servicemanId}/skills/`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.skills;
}

// Usage in React component
function ServicemanProfile({ servicemanId }) {
  const [skills, setSkills] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServicemanSkills(servicemanId).then(setSkills);
  }, [servicemanId]);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Skills:</h3>
      <ul>
        {skills.map(skill => (
          <li key={skill.id}>
            <strong>{skill.name}</strong> - {skill.category}
            <p>{skill.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```

## üîí Permissions

### Skill Creation/Management
- **Create**: Admin only
- **Update**: Admin only
- **Delete (Soft)**: Admin only
- **List**: Public (no authentication required)
- **Detail**: Public (no authentication required)

### Serviceman Skills
- **View**: Public
- **Add**: Serviceman themselves or Admin
- **Remove**: Serviceman themselves or Admin

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Skills not appearing in profile**
- Ensure skills are marked as `is_active=True`
- Verify skill IDs exist in database
- Check serviceman profile is created

**Cannot add skills**
- Verify authentication token is valid
- Ensure user is the serviceman or an admin
- Check skill IDs are valid and active

**Skills validation errors during registration**
- Ensure all skill IDs exist in database
- Verify skills are active
- Check skills array format is correct

## üìä Database Migration

After implementing skills system, run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Sample Data Creation

Create sample skills via admin interface or Django shell:

```python
python manage.py shell

from apps.users.models import Skill

# Create technical skills
Skill.objects.create(
    name="Electrical Wiring",
    category="TECHNICAL",
    description="Installation and repair of electrical systems"
)

Skill.objects.create(
    name="Plumbing",
    category="TECHNICAL",
    description="Installation and repair of water systems"
)

# Create manual skills
Skill.objects.create(
    name="Carpentry",
    category="MANUAL",
    description="Wood working and furniture making"
)

# ... add more skills
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
