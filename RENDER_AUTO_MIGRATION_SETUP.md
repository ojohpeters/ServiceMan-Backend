# 🚀 Automatic Migrations on Render - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What I Just Set Up

I've configured your project to **automatically run migrations** every time you deploy to Render!

### Files Created/Updated:

1. **`render.yaml`** - Render configuration file
   - Defines build and start commands
   - Tells Render to run migrations automatically

2. **`build.sh`** - Build script
   - Installs dependencies
   - Collects static files
   - **Runs migrations automatically** 🎉
   - Executable and ready to use

---

## 🔧 What Happens Now

### On Every Render Deploy:

```bash
📦 Installing Python dependencies...
   ↓
🗂️ Collecting static files...
   ↓
🗄️ Running database migrations...  ← YOUR MIGRATIONS RUN HERE!
   ↓
✅ Build completed!
   ↓
🚀 Starting application...
```

---

## 📋 Next Steps

### Option A: If render.yaml is Auto-Detected (Recommended)

Just **git push** and Render will:
1. Detect the `render.yaml` file
2. Run the `build.sh` script
3. **Migrations will run automatically!** ✨

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add automatic migrations on deploy"
git push origin main
```

### Option B: If render.yaml is NOT Used

Update your Render dashboard manually:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your **serviceman-backend** service
3. Go to **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
4. Update **Build Command** to:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
   OR (if build.sh doesn't work):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Click **Manual Deploy** → **Deploy latest commit**

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deploy

After the next deployment, test the booking fee endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://serviceman-backend.onrender.com/api/payments/initialize-booking-fee/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"is_emergency": false}'
```

### ✅ Success Response (After Migrations):
```json
{
  "payment": {
    "id": 1,
    "payment_type": "INITIAL_BOOKING",
    "amount": "2000.00",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "is_emergency": false
  },
  "paystack_url": "https://checkout.paystack.com/...",
  "amount": "2000.00",
  "reference": "BOOKING-1-1729606123.456",
  "message": "Please complete payment of ₦2,000.00 to proceed"
}
```

### ❌ Error Response (Before Migrations):
```json
{
  "error": "Database migration required",
  "detail": "The booking fee payment feature requires database migrations..."
}
```

## 📊 Verify Migrations Ran

Check your Render deployment logs to see migrations running:

```
📦 Installing Python dependencies...
✓ Successfully installed Django-4.2.25 ...

🗂️ Collecting static files...
128 static files copied to '/opt/render/project/src/staticfiles'.

🗄️ Running database migrations...
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, negotiations, notifications, payments, ratings, services, sessions, users
Running migrations:
  Applying payments.0003_payment_booking_fee_support... OK

✅ Build completed successfully!
```

Look for: `Applying payments.0003_payment_booking_fee_support... OK`

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Permission Denied"
The `build.sh` script needs to be executable. I've already set this, but if it fails:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
git add build.sh
git commit -m "fix: Make build.sh executable"
git push
```

### Migrations Don't Run
1. Check Render logs for the build phase
2. Verify the build command is set to `./build.sh`
3. Try using the full command instead:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput && python manage.py migrate
   ```

### "No such file or directory: build.sh"
Make sure the file is committed and pushed:
```bash
git add build.sh render.yaml
git commit -m "Add build script"
git push
```

## 🎯 What This Solves

### Before:
- ❌ Manual migration required via shell
- ❌ 503 errors until migrations run
- ❌ Feature doesn't work after deploy

### After:
- ✅ Migrations run automatically on every deploy
- ✅ No manual intervention needed
- ✅ Features work immediately after deploy
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments

---

## 📝 Future Deployments

From now on, whenever you:
1. Create new migrations with `python manage.py makemigrations`
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Render deploys automatically

**Migrations will run automatically!** No more manual steps! 🎊

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Migration Safety**: Our migrations are non-blocking and safe for production
2. **Rollback**: If something goes wrong, Render keeps previous deployments
3. **Logs**: Always check build logs to confirm migrations ran successfully
4. **Environment Variables**: Make sure all required env vars are set in Render

---

## ✨ You're All Set!

Just **git push** and watch the magic happen! 🪄

The booking fee payment feature will be fully operational after the next deployment.
