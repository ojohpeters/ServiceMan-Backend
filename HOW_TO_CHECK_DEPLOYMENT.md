## ‚è∞ Timeline

**Old logs you're seeing**: 08:15:30  
**Fix pushed**: ~08:27  
**Fix deployed**: ~08:30 (wait 3-5 minutes after push)

The logs at 08:15:30 are from the **OLD CODE** before the fix!

## ‚úÖ How to Check if New Code is Live

### Step 1: Check Render Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: **serviceman-backend** service
3. Check **Events** tab
4. Look for: `Deploy live for...` with recent timestamp
5. Verify the commit message says: **"Fix: Create ServicemanProfile if it doesn't exist"**

### Step 2: Look for New Log Messages

After deployment completes, try PATCH again and look for these **NEW** log messages:

```
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - existing columns: [...]
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - fields to defer: [...]
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - executing query for user X
```

**If profile exists**:
```
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - profile retrieved: <ServicemanProfile...>
ServicemanProfileView.partial_update - starting for user X
ServicemanProfileView.partial_update - request data: {...}
```

**If profile doesn't exist** (will create it):
```
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - Profile doesn't exist for user X, creating...
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - Profile created: <ServicemanProfile...>
ServicemanProfileView.partial_update - starting for user X
```

### Step 3: Test the Endpoint

**Wait 5 minutes from push time (~08:27)**, then try:

```bash
PATCH /api/users/serviceman-profile/
Body: {
  "bio": "Test update",
  "years_of_experience": 5
}
```

## üîç What to Look For

### In Render Logs (AFTER new deployment):

**OLD CODE (before fix)**:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Oct/2025:08:15:30...] "PATCH..." 500
# No "ServicemanProfileView.get_object" messages
```

**NEW CODE (after fix)**:
```
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - existing columns: [...]  ‚Üê NEW!
ServicemanProfileView.get_object - fields to defer: [...]   ‚Üê NEW!
...
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Oct/2025:08:32:XX...] "PATCH..." 200 ‚Üê Success!
```

### In API Response:

**OLD CODE**:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head><title>Server Error (500)</title>...
```

**NEW CODE** (if still error):
```json
{
  "error": "Partial update failed",
  "detail": "actual error message",
  "traceback": "..."
}
```

**NEW CODE** (if success):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "user": 12,
  "bio": "Test update",
  "years_of_experience": 5,
  ...
}
```

## üìã Checklist

Before testing:
- [ ] Wait 5 minutes after git push (~08:27)
- [ ] Check Render shows "Deploy live" with new commit
- [ ] Current time is past 08:32

Then test:
- [ ] Try PATCH request
- [ ] Check Render logs for "ServicemanProfileView.get_object" messages
- [ ] Verify response is JSON (not HTML)

## üïê Current Status

**Git push time**: ~08:27  
**Expected live**: ~08:32  
**Your log timestamp**: 08:15:30 ‚Üê **This is OLD!**

**Action**: Wait until 08:32, then test again and check for new log messages!

## üí° Quick Test

If you want to verify new code is live without testing PATCH:

```bash
# This will show the new error format if there's an issue
curl -X GET https://serviceman-backend.onrender.com/api/users/servicemen/1/
```

If you see JSON response (not HTML), new code is live!
