# âš¡ Serviceman Availability - Quick Guide

## âœ… What Was Implemented

**Auto-Management System** that:
1. Sets serviceman to **BUSY** when job is `IN_PROGRESS`
2. Sets serviceman to **AVAILABLE** when all jobs are done
3. Shows **warnings** to clients when booking busy servicemen
4. Provides **smart recommendations** to choose available servicemen
5. **Always allows booking** - no one is ever blocked

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### For Clients
- See if serviceman is **Available** (green badge) or **Busy** (orange badge)
- See how many **active jobs** they have
- Get **warned** if booking busy serviceman
- Get **recommendation** to choose available serviceman
- Can **still book** busy servicemen if they prefer

### Automatic
- âœ… No manual updates needed
- âœ… Updates in real-time via signals
- âœ… Handles multiple simultaneous jobs
- âœ… Works for backup servicemen too
