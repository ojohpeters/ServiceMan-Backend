# ðŸš¨ WSGI Application Fix

## The Problem
Railway couldn't find the WSGI_APPLICATION Django setting, which is required for deployment.

## âœ… What I Fixed

1. **Created `config/wsgi.py`** - The WSGI application file
2. **Added `WSGI_APPLICATION` setting** to `config/settings/base.py`
3. **Created `config/asgi.py`** - ASGI application file for completeness
4. **Updated `nixpacks.toml`** - Proper build configuration

## ðŸš€ Deploy the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add WSGI application configuration"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Fixes

- âœ… Django can now find the WSGI application
- âœ… Railway deployment will work properly
- âœ… Gunicorn can serve your Django app
- âœ… All API endpoints will be accessible

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variables Still Needed

Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.railway.app
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/database
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend
```

## ðŸ§ª Test After Deployment

Once deployed, test with:
```bash
curl https://your-app-name.railway.app/api/services/categories/
```

Should return your categories data!
